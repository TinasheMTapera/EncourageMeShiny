EncourageMe is a simple RShiny-based web-app that generates random encouragements, inspirational quotes, bible verses, and song lyrics. They're not all positive as some times you need to hear a negative thought reflected back to you in order to process it, but the majority of them are very uplifting.

The app demonstrates a little bit of web programming using CSS and HTML, all in the context of R.

To-Do:

1. give nice description
2. ~~deploy on git~~
3. store quotes on a server as opposed to static CSV
4. credit image(s) and quotes
